It includes part of the following database for Laman graphs:

** Installation
To install this package:

#+begin_src julia
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/YueRen/TropicalGalaxies.jl.git")
#+end_src

** Usage

*** Laman graphs
To construct a Laman graph from the [[https://zenodo.org/records/1245517][database]], specify its number of vertices and its index:

#+begin_src julia
  G = laman_graph(5,1)
  G = laman_graph(5,2)
  G = laman_graph(5,3)
#+end_src

*** Excisions of Laman graphs
To excise a multiedge, specify its pair of vertices:

#+begin_src julia
  G = triangle_chain(4)
  HH = excise(G, [2, 3])
  FF = excise(HH, [1, 5])
#+end_src

The (Laman) graph `G`:

The excised triangle $\mathbb{H}=G\curvearrowright 1$:

The fully excised $\mathbb{F}=G\curvearrowright 1 \curvearrowright 5$

*** Tropical galaxies of Laman graphs
To construct a tropical galaxy, specify its Laman graph:

#+begin_src julia
  G = triangle_chain(4)
  Gamma = tropical_galaxy(G)
#+end_src

The tropical galaxy $\Gamma_G$:
